# TL;DR C++

This repo covers the implemnetation of basic data sctructures and algorithms for c++. Mostly the data sctructures and algorithms will be first implmented using basic c++/c syntax and structure but later on it will be using more advanced c++ concepts like templates, classes, inheritance and objects.

If using this repo to learn c++, then make sure that you are also refering to a c++ tutorial or wiki so that certain concepts which are not explained can be refered from there. 

This repo is not mend to introduce c++, it is meant to help implement the language in various situations to grasp and better appreciate the beauty that lies in this language.
