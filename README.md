# TL;DR Programming Languages

This repo is a collection of data structures and other programming code base I used while learning a new programming language or used to brush up my skills in an existing known language.

Contains my notes, sample programs and references to get started in a programming language.

This by no means covers all the concepts or is beginner friendly.
