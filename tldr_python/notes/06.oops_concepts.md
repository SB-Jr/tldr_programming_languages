# Object Oriented Programming in Python

4 basic pillars in OOPs are the:

- Abstraction

- Encapsulation

- Inheritance

- Polymorphism



## Abstraction

It is the method of not showing the intrinsic details of the logic behind a use case and giving the user an end point to just use it without being overwhelmed by the logic details. This is achieved in Python with the help of functions, classes and interfaces in Python.



## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the method of clubbing together the similar units and keeping the dis-similar units separated. This is achieved in Python using the concepts of functions, classes, modules and packages.



## Inheritance

This is the method of logically arranging code pieces in a hierarchy such that the code is reused and any changes made in 1 part of the arrangement also reflects in the other part if they are arranged in that manner. This is implemented in Python using the inheritance concept in Python.   



## Polymorphism

This is the method of using same name but for different tasks such that based on the context we can use the same name but it will perform the task according to the context. This is achieved by overloading and overriding in Python.
