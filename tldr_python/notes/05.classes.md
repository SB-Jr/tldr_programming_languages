# Python Classes

When we create a class we are provided with some initial attributes like:

- `self`: the object variable

- `__dict__`: Dictionary containing the namespace of the class

- `__bases__`: Tuple containing the parent classes

- `__module__`: String containing the name of the module in which the class is defined.

- `__name__`: String containing the name of the class

- `__doc__`: String containing the doc-string defining the class written just below the class name using double triple quotes.

## Public, Private and Protected

Classes can have attributes of public, private and protected types.

- Public: `attr`

- Protected: `_attr`

- Private: `__attr`
