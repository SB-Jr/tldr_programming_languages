# Dart Basics

- Dart's main method is named `main()` or, if you need access to comand line arguments, `main(List<String> args)`.

- The `main()` method lives at the top level. In Dart, you can define code outside of classes. Variables, functions, getters, and setters can all live outside of classes.

- All identifiers are public by default. Dart doesn't have keywords for public, private, or protected.

- Dart uses two-character indentation by convention instead of four.

- Constructor for a class can be written without having a body. Dart follows a minimal way of writting methods.

- Remove the optional new keyword while creating instances.

- The `@override` annotation tells the analyzer that you are intentionally overriding a member. The analyzer raises an error if you failed to properly perform the override.

- Dart supports single or double quotes when specifying strings.

- Use string interpolation to put the value of an expression inside a string literal: `${expression}`. If the expression is an identifier, you can skip the braces: `$variableName`.

- Shorten one-line functions or methods using fat arrow `=>` notation.
  eg:

  ```dart
  class A {
    int a;
    int b;
    int c;
    A(this.a, this.b, this.c);  //no body constructor
  }
  
  class B {
  	@override
    String toString() => 'This is B';    //can use both '' or "" to denote string
  }
  
  void main() {  //using main outside any class definition
    var instA = A(1,2,4);  // instA is of type A here denoted using var
    print(instA);          //will output -> Instance of 'A'
    
    var instB = B();
    print(instB);          //will output -> "This is B"
  }
  ```
