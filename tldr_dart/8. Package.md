# Packages in Dart

Dart packages are simply a directory full of dart programs. 

Dart comes with an inbuilt Package Manager known as `pub` package manager. It can be used to install, organize and manage 3rdparty dart libraries, tools and dependencies. Every Dart package has a pubsec.yaml file that keeps a track of the 3rdparty libraries and application dependecies along with the metadata of applications like application name, author, version and description.

Basic pib commands:

- `pub get`: get all packages the application is dependent upon.
- `pub upgrade`: upgrade all the application dependencies to the lastest version
- `pub build`: used to build the application
- `pub help`: command that can be used to get information on other commands
