# Variable Security

- To mark a Dart identifier as private to its library, start its name with an underscore (`_`).

- The Dart compiler enforces library privacy for any identifier prefixed with an underscore. <b>*Library privacy* generally means that the identifier is visible only inside the file (not just the class) that the identifier is defined in.</b>

- Uninitialized variables (even numbers) have the value `null`.

- By default, Dart provides implicit getters and setters for all public instance variables. You don't need to define your own getters or setters unless you want to enforce read-only or write-only variables, compute or verify a value, or update a value elsewhere

- eg:

  ```dart
  class B{
  	int a;
  	int b;
  	int _c = 0;     //this is now private and inititialized to 0 otherwise it will be default initiailized to null
  	
  	int get c => _c;
  	
  	B(this.a, this.b);   //consructor to initialize a and b while object creation
  	
  	@override
  	String toString() => 'This object has a=$a, b=$b, c=$_c values';
  }
  
  void main(){
  	var b = B(1,2);
  	print(b);      //will print "this object has a=1, b=2, c=0 values"
  }
  ```
