# Inheritance

Dart is an object oriented programming language. Thus it follows basic OOPs concepts as well like Inheritance.

Type of inheritance:

- Single Level
- Mutlilevel
- Multiple - not supported in Dart

## Single Level

```dart
class ClassA {
  //class definition
  
  void method1() {
    
  }
  
  void method2() {
    
  }
}

class ClassB extends ClassA {
  //class definition
  
  @override
  void method2() {
    
  }
  
  void method3() {
    
  }
}
```

## Multi-Level

```dart
class ClassA {
  void method1() {
    
  }
  
  void method2() {
    
  }
}

class ClassB extends ClassA {
  
  @override
  void method2() {
    
  }
  
  void method3() {
    
  }
}

class ClassC extends ClassB {
  @override
  void method3() {
    
  }
  
  void method4() {
    
  }
}
```

## Constructor Inheritance

Subclasses in Dart don’t inherit the parent class’s constructor. To inherit a named constructor of the base class in the subclass we need to define the named constructor in the subclass as well. 

```dart
class Location {
  num lat, long;
  
  Location (this.lat, this.long);  //general constructor
}

class ElevatedLocation {
  num elevation;  //lat and long are inherited
  
  ElevatedLocation(num lat, num long, this.elevation) : super(lat, long); //callling the parent constructor
}
```

```dart
class Location {
  num lat, long;
  
  Location(this.lat, this.long); //general constructor
  
  Location.create(this.lat, this.long); //named constructor
}

class ElevatedLocation {
  num elevation;
  
  ElevatedLocation (num lat, num long, this.elevation) : super.create(lat, long); //calling the parent 'create' named constructor
}
```





## Abstract Classes

As a oop concept, we can build Abstract classes in Dart by using the `abstract` keyword.

Do note that the abstract classes cant be instantiated(i.e. you cant create object of these classes).If a subclass doesn’t implement all the methods of a parent abstract class then it also has to be declared abstract.

- Abstract classes may or may not include abstract method.
- An abstract class may also have concrete methods.
- If we inherit an abstract class we have to provide implementations to all the abstract methods or else we will have to declare the subclass also as an abstract class.

```dart
abstract class ParentAbstractA{
  void abstractMethod();
}

class SubClass extends ParentAbstractA {
  @override
  void abstractMethod() {
    // implementation
  }
}
```



## Interfaces

We can also create interfaces in Dart like in Java but we don’t need to use any extra keyword to declare it. In Dart <b>there is an implicit interface created for each class we define</b>, thus the `class` keyword itself is used to define an interface. A class in Dart can implement multiple interfaces. This way we can achieve so called multiple inheritance.

The only thing to remember is that the subclass that will implement the interface needs to use the `implements` keyword and not the `extends` keyword.

```dart
class InterfaceClass {
  void method1(){};
  void method2(){};
}

class SubClass implements InterfaceClass {
  @override
  void method1() {
    //implementation
  }
  
  @override
  void method2() {
    //implementation
  }
} 
```

Multiple inheritance

```dart
class InterfaceClass1 {
  void method1();
}

class InterfaceClass2 {
  void method2();
}

class SubClass implements InterfaceClass1, InterfaceClass2 {
  @override
  void method1() {
    //implementation
  }
  
  @override
  void method2() {
    //implementation
  }
}
```
