# Exceptions

Dart code can throw and catch exceptions. In contrast to Java, all of Dart’s exceptions are unchecked exceptions. Methods don’t declare which exceptions they might throw, and you aren’t required to catch any exceptions.

## Throwing an Exception

different ways of throwing an exception:

```dart
throw Exception('This is an Exception');

throw 'this is an another Exception';
```

## Cathing and Exception

We can use `try{ } cathch() { }` block to catch certain Exceptions.

```dart
try {
  someMethodThatThrowsException();
} on ExceptionType1 {
  //if above method throws ExceptionType1 exception then this block is executed
  handleExceptionType1Method();
} on ExceptionType2 {
  // similarly this block is executed if ExceptionType2 is thrown
  handleExceptionType2Method();
} on Exception catch (e) {
  // this is executed if any execption is thrown that cant be handled in the above catch blocks, the exception object is stored in 'e'
  print('Some other type of exception is thrown: $e')
} catch (e) {
  //this block handles all kind
  print ('Something is thrown: $e')
}
```

## Finally

To execute a certain block in both the cases i.e. a) exception is thrown OR b) exception is not thrown, we can wrap that code in a `finally` block.

```dart
try {
	someMethod();  //might or might not throw an exception 
} catch (e) {
  print('An exception is thrown: $e');
} finally() {
  print('The code ends here, this is shown if no execption is thrown or even if and exception is thrown')
}
```

## Rethrow Exception

Sometimes we might not need to handle an exception fully. We can just handle it partially like here:

```dart
try {
  someMethodThatThrowsException();
} catch (e) {
 print('Some exception is thrown but we can only partially handle it : $e');
  rethrow; // this throws the same exception object 'e' to the calling method
}
```
