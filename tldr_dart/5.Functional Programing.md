# Functional Programing

In functional programming you can do things like the following:

- Pass functions as arguments.

- Assign a function to a variable.

- Deconstruct a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument (also called *currying*).

- Create a nameless function that can be used as a constant value (also called a *lambda expression*)

- In Dart, even functions are objects and have a type, `Function`. 

- You can also call an instance of a Dart class as if it were a function.

- eg:

  ```Dart
  class WannabeFunction {
    call(String a, String b, String c) => '$a $b $c!';   //if object is called as a function then this method is invoked
  }
  
  main() {
    var wf = new WannabeFunction();
    var out = wf("Hi","there,","gang");     //calling object as if it was a function
    print('$out');
  }
  ```

  

- When using string interpolation, the string `${'a' * length}` evaluates to "the character `'a'` repeated `length` times."

- eg:

  ```dart
  String sream(int len) => "A${'a' * len}h";
  
  main() {
    final val = [1,2,3,5,10];    //no datatype provided for list
    for (v in val) {
      print(sream(v));
    }
    //OR
    val.map(scream).forEach(print);    //lambda way of doing the same
  }
  ```

  

- The core `List` and `Iterable` classes support `fold()`, `where()`, `join()`, `skip()`, and more. Dart also has built-in support for maps and sets.

- eg:

- ```dart
  val.skip(1).take(3).map(scream).forEach(print);   //skips 1st item in the list and then takes first 3 items of the remaining list and maps it to Scream function and then executes print function on it
  ```
