# Constructor

The main difference between a method and a constructor are:

- it has the same name as that of the class which it belongs to
- constructor doesnt have a return type
- Constructor is automatically called when we create a new object of that class
- If we don’t create a constructor then a default no argument constructor will be created

Like methods, constructor also cant be overloaded in Dart



```dart
class ClassName {
  //variables
  
  //constructor
  ClassName(/*parameteres*/) {
    //variable initialization
  }
}
```

We can also create a single line short constructor if our main work is to just initialize the variables of a class object

```dart
class ClassName {
	//var list
	ClassName (this.variable1, this.variable2, /*and other this.vars*/)
}

void main () {
  ClassName obj1 = ClassName(1,2,/*3,4, etc*/);
}
```

## Named Constructor

As stated earlier we can’t overload constructors like in Java or C++. In place of that we can use optional parameters or Name Constructors in dart.

```dart
class ClassName {
  //variable list
  
  ClassName.NameConstructor1 (/*variable list*/);
  
  ClassName.NamedConstructor2 (/*variable list*/);
}

void main () {
  ClassName obj1 = ClassName.NamedConstructor1();
  ClassName obj2 = ClassName.NamedConstructor2();
}
```

## Const Constructor

If the class produces object which can’t change during the execution we can make the object compile time constant. For this we only need to make the constructor `const` so that it returns constant objects which are immutable.

```dart
class ImmutableClass {
  
  const ImmutableClass ();
}
```

## Redirecting constructors

If we have multiple constructors (using the name constructor feature) we can reuse the constructors by calling them from other constructors. This way we need not write the same initialization steps again and again in the named constructors.

```dart
class ClassA {
  num a,b,c,d;
  ClassA(this.a, this.b);
  
  ClassA.initC(num a, num b,this.c) : this(a,b) //note: we used this() to call the constructor and not the name
    
    ClassA.initD(num a, num b, this.d) : this(a,b);
    
    ClassA.initCAndD(num a, num b, num c, this.d) : this.initC(a,b,c); //note: as the constructor we need to initialize C is a named constructor thats why we use this.NameConstrutor() way of calling the constructor
}
```
