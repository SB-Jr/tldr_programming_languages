# Iterations in Dart

Dart like other languages provide looping constructs to loop through list and other data items. The looping constructs provided by Dart are:

- `for()` loop
- `forEach()` loop
- `while()` loop
- `do{...}while()` loop



## For loop

The syntax is simple and resembles many other programing languages

```dart
for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
  print(i);
}
```



## ForEach loop

The for each loop can be used to iterate through collections like lists.

```dart
forEach(var in varList) {
  print(var);
}
```



## While Loop

Like Java, Dart also has while loop where only the termination statement is needed in the condition area.

```dart
int i=0;
while(i<10){
  print(i);
  i++;
}
```



## Do...While loop

Again like Java, Dart also supports Do...while loop.

```dart
int i=0;
do {
  print(i);
  i++;
}while(i<10);
```
