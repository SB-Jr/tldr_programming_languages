# Understanding Languages

We have many programming languages and each of them serve separate purpose. Sometimes they compete with each other to offer better feature set for a specific use case, sometimes we can only use a single programming language to solve a specific problem.

No language is perfect and neither is there a single language to rule all of the use cases. Each language differs from the others based on the frameworks that are present for it and the community present to help if in case we ever get stuck with a problem.

## The Tasks

We can divide our use cases in separate tasks before we jump into choosing a language. This will not only help us to better understand our problem but will also help us to define the scope and thus narrowing our search results.
